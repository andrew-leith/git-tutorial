Git and Github Basic Tutorial

Git and Github are two related tools for managing code, documentation, and related files.  Used in concert, they facilitate **version control** - the process of editing files while maintaining a continous history of previous iterations of those files.  

Git is a command-line tool for tracking changes in files; it also enables synchronization of files between a user's computer and a remote **repository** (sometimes abbreviated "repo") where files are hosted.  Repositories are used to store files for a variety of reasons - backup/archiving, publication, and collaboration between multiple developers are among the most common use cases for respositories.  The most well-known repository hosts are Github, Gitlab, and Bitbucket; this document is hosted on the andrew-leith/git-tutorial repository on Github.
